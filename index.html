    <p>paragraph: the beginning</p>
    <h2>testing out headings</h2>
    <p>paragraph: I suck at hitting the colon key (:) and the apostrophe key (')</p>
    <h3>heading: the trilogy</h3>
    <p>I lowkey regret cracking my knuckles so much in high school cause now my fingers are abnormally long</p>
    <h4>headings 3 and 4 are part of the next push</h4>
    <p>typing stuff damn i forgot what I was going to say. Maybe it was typing related? Hate when that happens</p>
    <h5>at this point i'm just curious to see how small the heading text gets</h5>
    <p>something something in your pants</p>
    <h6>let's see how small this is</h6>
    <p>DK if you see this text "geopolitical climate of uranus" to me LMAO</p>
